            If your printer is indicating that it is "Out of Paper", Please follow these steps:
            1. Open the printer's papaer tray
            2. Check if there is paper in the tray and if it's properly aligned to avoid paper jamming
            3. If the paper is out, add more paper to the tray.
            4. Close the paper tray and try printing again
